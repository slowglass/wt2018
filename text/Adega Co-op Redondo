Adega Co-op Redondo

In the 20th century, after the widespread destruction caused by phylloxera and other vine plagues, it was the co-operatives that revitalised Portugal’s wine industry. In this spirit, Adega Co-op Redondo was founded by 14 winemakers in 1956. Today, the co-op is one of Alentejo’s largest producers – at around 200 growers strong – and it cultivates roughly 98% of the sub-region Redondo. 

Here, the vineyards have a continental climate with Mediterranean influences: it can be too hot in the summer, with very low rainfall, which sometimes leads to drought. The poor, granitic soils are excellent for vine growth, encouraging roots to dig several metres into the earth for nourishment. 

Alentejo – a region responsible for a huge amount of Portugal's cork production – is a beautiful region, with stunning plains and hills and hospitable, hard-working people. The local delicacies – charcuterie, lamb stew and gazpacho, in particular – are the perfect accompaniment to the region’s modest red and white wines. 

Vines have been planted here since the Roman times, however it wasn’t until the 1980s that the region’s potential really flourished. During this period, Adega Co-op Redondo invested hundreds of thousands of euros into harvest, production, storage and winemaking, and it now has excellent modern facilities. 

Redondo is conscious that the rapid growth of Alentejo has led to some overall dips in quality, and has strived to showcase all the region truly has to offer, from good, honest, everyday wines to more premium varieties. Its biggest importer is Brazil, but the team has worked hard to reach more of an old world audience in a bid to raise the profile of Portuguese wine production in Europe.
