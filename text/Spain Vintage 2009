Spain Vintage 2009
Average temperatures in Rioja and Ribera del Duero in 2009 were actually higher than for the infamous heatwave year of 2003 and it was warmer than the delightful 2010 vintage. The saving grace was rainfall at pertinent moments, bringing respite to the vines and giving the fruit some timely refreshment. Both Rioja and Ribera therefore enjoyed good vintages with many quality wines made in both, though acidity is a little down. The best show their pedigree but there may be some wines that are a little out of balance. 

In Navarra it was a good vintage with later ripening grapes like cabernet doing best amongst the red, though all were good. Whites fared less well. 

Catalonia also enjoyed a good vintage despite heat spikes as milder temperatures came along at the end of August and welcome rainfall in September freshened up the vines. 

Galicia in the north-west had a truly excellent vintage as their cooler, coastal climate helped to provide cool nights after hot, sunny days.

In the south the vintage was complicated by rains at inopportune moments after the heat of the summer and early pickling was required around Alicante. La Mancha saw an early harvest but despite this alcohol levels were generally high and volumes were down.
