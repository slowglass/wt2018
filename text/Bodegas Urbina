Bodegas Urbina

The Urbina family have four generations under their helm as vineyard owners in Rioja. They own around 75 hectares, all in the heart of the renowned sub-region of Rioja Alta which is known to produce grapes with fine structure and elegance. 

The vineyards, mostly planted to tempranillo, are located around the village of Cuzcurrita which is at the north-west point of Rioja and therefore at the limit of vine production. Here the climate is influenced by the cooler Atlantic weather systems which results in a longer, more gradual ripening period and grapes that tend to show freshness, structure and intensity. The magic of this area is that it makes wines that are amongst some of the longest lived in Rioja.

Everything about this bodega centres around ageing. After picking, the grapes are fermented slowly in stainless steel, then aged extensively in a mixture of American (75%) and French (25%) barrels. After ageing in oak, the wines are held in tank which retains a lift and freshness in the wines (rarely seen for this traditional style of Rioja). 

Pedro Benito Urbina makes a range of wines, mostly red, right across the quality spectrum from crianza to gran reserva. He releases his wines when they are ready to drink and fully mature. They represent the essence of classic Rioja: stylistically they rest their quality on finesse, complexity and savoury flavours, rather than power.
