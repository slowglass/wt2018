Portugal Vintage 2016
The varied regions of Portugal mean there is no single picture at harvest time. As in other parts of Europe, a damp spring led to widespread mildew, cooler flowering than conditions than normal, reducing yield, and summer drought. This delayed ripening and the start of harvest, and meant that September rain was welcomed more warmly than usual. Volumes are down in some cases but not dramatically.

In the Douro the combination of heat and vine stress over the summer meant it was a challenging year for the DOC wines but extremely promising for Ports. 

In the Alentejo, harvest started about a fortnight later than usual with the double challenges of uneven ripeness and low acidity (in an area of high summer temperatures where acidity is generally not high anyway).

The 2016 viticultural year in the Douro started well with a wet winter, double the rainfall of the previous year. Unexpectedly wet weather carried on through April/May causing the river to be in full spring flood and unnavigable. June and July were normal summer weather, August unusually hot with rain at the month end. Some picking was delayed until late September and finished in the first week of October. Some very fine quality Ports will be produced.
