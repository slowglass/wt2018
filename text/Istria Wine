Istria Wine

Istria (Istra, in Croatian) is the northernmost of Croatia's wine regions. It occupies the majority of the Istrian Peninsula (the northern end of which is part of south-western Slovenia, providing the latter country's only area of coastline) and is rapidly developing as one of Croatia's key wine regions. Its fruity, dry white wines are proving successful in international and domestic markets, largely due to the modern, refreshing styles in which they are now made.

Although typically produced from various light-skinned forms of Malvasia (the epitome of Old World grape varieties), Istrian wines are often made in decidedly New World styles: crisp, refreshing, fruit-forward and aromatic. Over the past few decades the popularity of internationally popular aromatics such as Pinot Gris, Sauvignon Blanc and Riesling has risen considerably in Istrian vineyards, accompanied by the reliably popular Chardonnay.

Although red wine grape varieties have not traditionally played any significant role for wineries here, or anywhere in coastal Croatia (Primorska Hrvatska), the global popularity of Syrah, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon has made these varieties new favorites among Istrian winemakers seeking a reliable return on their investment. These French grape varieties now grow cheek by jowl in Istrian vineyards with Teran, the traditional red wine grape variety of this area and a member of the diverse Refosco family.
