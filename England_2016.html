	<h2>England Vintage 2016</h2>
	<div><p>
2016 has been an excellent year for English wines, especially sparkling and especially from vineyards in Sussex, where we have seen an excellent balance of ripeness and fresh acidity. There were no dramatic weather patterns, and summer temperatures were mostly good so grapes ripened well, although a frosty April meant lower yields in many areas. The smaller berry sizes for many growers this year have resulted in nicely concentrated wines and the dry period from August to harvest time helped ensure that the grapes were in excellent condition. Overall, low yields and very good quality: certainly a year to be excited about.
