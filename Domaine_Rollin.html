	<h2>Domaine Rollin Père et Fils</h2>
	<div><p>
A family domaine run by Rémi Rollin and his son Simon who are the third and fourth generation respectively to make wine in the little village of Pernand-Vergelesses. 
</p><p>
It all began when Rémi’s grandfather Maurice slowly accumulated plots in the appellation while working as a vineyard worker. His son Maurice took them over in 1955 and added more parcels when he could and bottled some of his wines for the first time. 1976 saw Rémi join him and Simon joined Rémi in 2003. 
</p><p>
This is very much a family affair, with all the vineyard and winery work done by father and son across 12 hectares, 8 of which are owned by the Rollins. Five communes and fourteen appellations are represented in their range, including several premiers crus in both red and white, including a small plot in the Ile de Vergelesses premier cru first purchased by Maurice in the 1930s, and part of the Corton Charlemagne grand cru more recently acquired. Their wines are very fine, with the potential for cellaring.
