	<h2>Alain Graillot</h2>
	<div>
	<p>
	Alain Graillot left a career in agro-chemicals in 1985 to follow a dream with a rented parcel of vines, on the site of a former pig farm, on the Chassis plateau between Tain l’Hermitage and Pont l’Isère in the appellation of Crozes Hermitage in the Northern Rhône. Today Alain is one of the most widely respected wine-makers in the Rhône valley whose wines grace the list of France’s finest restaurants and who counts many celebrated wine-makers among his circle of friends. The Graillot philosophy is as simple as it is successful – to produce appealing, sensibly-priced wines that people will want to drink. Today Alain’s vineyard is comprised of 17.3 hectares of Syrah vines and 2.6 hectares of Marsanne and Roussanne vines (planted in a ratio of 80% Marasanne to 20% Roussanne) which surround his cellars at Les Chênes Verts. This is a great source of clean but characterful, fruit-accentuated red and white Crozes Hermitage for gratifying forward drinking. In favourable vintages Alain also produces small volumes of a more age-worthy, denser Crozes Hermitage called ‘La Guiraude’. Minimal volumes of Saint Joseph and Hermitage are also made. Since 2004 Alain’s son Maxime (born in 1977) has followed in his father’s footsteps and has been producing a fruity red Crozes Hermitage from a neighbouring 6.5 hectare vineyard at Beaumont-Monteux.
