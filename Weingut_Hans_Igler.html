	<h2>Weingut Hans Igler</h2>
	<div><p>
This estate in Austria’s Burgenland is best known for its red wines. Hans Igler was a red wine legend in his homeland; in the1970s he was among the first in Austria to make his wines completely dry and in the 1980s he was also one of the avant-garde set who defied the norm by maturing his wines in small French oak barrels. 
</p><p>
After her father’s death, Waltraud Reisner-Igler dedicated herself to continuing her father’s vision for the wines and together with her husband Wolfgang Reisner took over the family winery, running it with an absolute commitment to quality. Their son Clement is now also involved in the family business as well as making his own wines. 
</p><p>
The Society is a regular follower of the Igler wines made from zweigelt - a relatively modern hybrid grape, which thrives in this part of Austria, producing wines that are deep and vibrant in colour with plump cherry flavours – and from the indigenous blaufränkisch grape which yields ample, smooth fruity reds not dissimilar in style to cru Beaujolais.
